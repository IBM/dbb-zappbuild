# Property File Management
#
# Flag to enable the zAppBuild capability to load individual artifact properties files for source files.
# Please see the detailed documentation on file property management at:
# https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild/docs/FilePropertyManagement.md
# Example 1: Enable individual artifact properties file for all COBOL files: loadFileLevelProperties=true :: **/cobol/*.cbl
# Example 2: The following file path pattern looks for an individual artifact properties file for epsmlist.cbl:
loadFileLevelProperties = true :: **/cobol/epsmlist.cbl 

#
# Language Configuration properties Management
#
# Flag to enable the zAppBuild capability to load language configuration properties files for source files.
# Please see the detailed documentation on file property management at:
# https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild/docs/FilePropertyManagement.md
# Example 1: Enable language configuration mapping for all COBOL files: loadLanguageConfigurationProperties=true :: **/cobol/*.cbl
# Example 2: The following file path pattern looks for a language configuration properties file mapping for epsnbrvl.cbl and epsmpmt.cbl 
# in the application-conf/languageconfigurationMapping.properties file:
loadLanguageConfigurationProperties = true :: **/cobol/epsnbrvl.cbl, **/cobol/epsmpmt.cbl, **/cobol/epscmort.cbl

#
# Properties mapping for assigning the language configuration to build files to specify the build configuration
# Please see the detailed documentation on file property management at:
# https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild/docs/FilePropertyManagement.md
# This option replaces the mapping of build files to language configuration in languageConfigurationMapping.properties file
#
