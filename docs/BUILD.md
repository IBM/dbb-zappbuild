# Building Applications with zAppBuild
The main or start build script for zAppBuild is `build.groovy`. Dependency Based Build (DBB) requires that the DBB_HOME environment variable be set when executing a Groovy script that uses DBB APIs.  In order to build an application using zAppBuild, change directory to the zAppBuild directory on USS and type `$DBB_HOME/bin/groovyz build.groovy`.

However this will result in an error message because the build.groovy script has four required arguments that must be present during each invocation:
* --workspace <arg> - Absolute path to workspace (root) directory containing all required source directories or local Git repositories to build the application.
* --application <arg> - Application local repository directory name (relative to workspace).
* --outDir <arg> - Absolute path to the build output root directory on USS
* --hlq <arg> -  High level qualifier for created build partition data sets


Example:
```sh
$DBB_HOME/bin/groovyz build.groovy \
                      --workspace /u/build/repos \
                      --application app1 \
                      --outDir /u/build/out \
                      --hlq BUILD.APP1
```
Since we are still missing a build target or calculated build option, the build will run successfully but not actually build any programs.  

## Common Pipeline Invocation Examples

**Build one program**
```sh
$DBB_HOME/bin/groovyz build.groovy \
                      --workspace /u/build/repos \

                      --hlq BUILD.APP1 \ 
                      --userBuild app1/cobol/epsmpmt.cbl
```
**Build one program using a [user build dependency file](samples/userBuildDependencyFile) predefining dependency information to skip DBB scans and dependency resolution.**

### Build a Single Program 

Build a single program in the application. 

By leveraging `--userBuild` zAppBuild does not intialize the MetadataStore and also does not store a build result.

### Build a List of Programs

In this build scenario, the build scope is defined through a text file, which references files to be build. The files are scanned and dependency metadata and a build result are stored in the DBB WebApp.
Either provide an absolute path to the build list file; otherwise it is assumed to be relative path within the workspace

Sample build list stored at `/var/dbb/MortgageApplication/myBuildList.txt` contains:
```
MortgageApplication/bms/epsmort.bms
MortgageApplication/cobol/epscmort.cbl
```

```

### Perform Impact Build 

`--impactBuild` builds only programs impacted by source files that have changed since the last successful build.

This build scenario identifies the changed files based on diffing the git baseline hash and the current hash; then the list of changed files is passed into the impact analysis phase, which will detect the impacted files based on the `impactResolutionRules` which are defined in application.properties.

### Perform Impact Build for topic branches 

zAppBuild is able to detect when building a topic branch for the first time. It will automatically clone the dependency data collections from the main build branch (see `mainBuildBranch` build property in application.properties) in order to avoid having to rescan the entire application.

It also leverages the last successful build result from the buildgroup of the `mainBuildBranch` configuration to obtain the baseline hash to calculate the changed files.

The invocation is similar to other impact builds (you might want to consider a dedicated set of build libraries):
```
groovyz dbb-zappbuild/build.groovy --workspace /var/dbb/dbb-zappbuild/samples --hlq DBB.ZAPP.CLEAN.FEAT --workDir /var/dbb/out/MortgageApplication --application MortgageApplication --logEncoding UTF-8 --impactBuild --verbose
```
Please see the output provided in verbose mode when setting up the collections as well as the calculation of changed files:

### Perform Impact Build by providing baseline reference for the analysis of changed files

Implementing a release-based approach will lead to combining several features into the release candidate, which is formed in a release branch. For more information please have a look to the documentation about git flow.

To create an incremental release candidate, the build framework needs to perform a consolidated build that includes all changed files and their impacts (potentially this build can use optimized compile options). In this situation, the first build on the release branch must be slightly different from the typical impact build of topic branches.

The invocation for this consolidated build is performed through the `--impactBuild` parameter with the use of an additional option, called `--baselineRef`. The command-line option `--baselineRef` allows you to specify the baseline hash/tag for each directory when running an impact analysis: each file that was changed, renamed or deleted between the baseline hash/tag and the current hash will be managed by the build framework, and will impact the scope of the impact build. The referenced directory needs to be in the list of the `applicationSrcDirs` build property.

The syntax for `--baselineRef` is a comma-seperated list of mappings for each application source dir. Each mapping is seperated by a colon:
```
--baselineRef <application source dir>:<gitReference>,<application source dir>:<gitReference>,...
```

Alternatively, for the main application directory reference, it is sufficient to specify `--baselineRef <gitReference>`. 

`gitReference` can either be a git commit hash or a git tag in the history.

Another scenario of this build setup is to run the build with the DBB reportOnly option to build a cumulative deployment package without rebuilding the binaries.

### Perform a Merge build

`--mergeBuild` calculate the changes of a topic branch flowing back into the `mainBuildBranch` reference. This build type does not perform calculation of impacted files.

The scenario is targeting for builds on topic branches. The scope of the build is focussing on the outgoing changes. It is not incremental. Any time you invoke this build, it will the changes which will be merged to the target reference. 

It leverages the git triple-dot diff syntax to identify the changes, similar to what can be seen in a pull/merge request.      

In the below case both `MortgageApplication/cobol/epsmlist.cbl` and `MortgageApplication/copybook/epsnbrpm.cpy` are changed, but only the `epsmlist.cbl` is built because it is mapped to a build script.

### Perform a Build in Preview Mode

`--preview` is a supplemental option to the various build types of zAppBuild. This supplemental option will let the build process run through all the build phases of the specified build option, but instead of executing the build commands such as copying the source files to the datasets or invoking the compile and link commands, it just documents what would be done and sets the return codes of these commands to 0. Please note, that file are scanned and, depending on the primary build option, dependency information is stored in the DBB Metadatastore.

For instance, use the `--preview` flag with the `--impactBuild` option to obtain a preview of the impact build actions such as identified changed files, the calculated impacted files, the build list, the build flow, the applied build properties and option including the outputs which would be produced.

Use the `--preview` flag with the `--fullBuild` option to produce the full bill of material (documented in a build report) for the artifacts that could be generated in the datasets pointed by the `hlq` parameter.

The build will generate a build report, which, depending of the provided build option, will be stored in the build group. However, the build result status is set to `4` and does not impact the calculation of changed file of subsequent impact builds.  

The below sample build log is documenting an `--impactBuild --preview` with the reporting capablities activated to what the build would do and any potential conflicts of concurrent development activities.

### Perform a Scan Source build

`--fullBuild --scanSource` skips the actual building and only scan source files to store dependency data in the collection (migration scenario). Please be aware that it scans all programs including the copybooks, which is required to perform proper impact analysis.

This build type also stores a build result to build a baseline for following impact builds.

### Perform a Scan Source + Outputs build 

`--fullBuild --scanAll` skips the actual building and only scan source files and existing load modules to dependency data in source and output collection (migration scenario with static linkage scenarios). This build type also stores a build result to build a baseline for following impact builds.

Please see also the [TechDoc for Advanced Build and Migration recipes](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6427617)

### Dynamically Overwrite build properties

Dependending on where are in your development process, you might want to dynamically overwrite a build property. One scenario is for example to set the `mainBuildBranch` option which is used also to clone collections and initialize the DBB collections. See [Perform Impact Build for topic branches](#perform-impact-build-for-topic-branches)

To dynamically overwrite any build property, you can make use of the `--propOverwrite` cli argument. To overwrite a build property, pass it in as a key-value pair via the CLI. Several key-value pairs can be passed by comma-separating them :`--propOverwrite mainBuildBranch=develop,cobol_compilerVersion=V6`. Please note, that values which contain a comma (`,`) cannot be passed into the list. Please also make sure that you don't run into any limitations with regards of the length of the overall build command. For mass overwrites, use the `--propFiles` option to pass in one or several property files.
