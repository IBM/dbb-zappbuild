# Conclusion

This document provides guidance for implementing a Git-based development process with IBM Dependency Based Build and zAppBuild for mainframe applications.

The CI/CD pipeline configurations that were outlined at various steps can be adjusted depending on the application team\'s existing and desired development processes and philosophy. Factors that might impact the design of the pipelines and workflow include test strategies, the number of test environments, and potential testing limitations.

When designing a CI/CD pipeline, assessment of current and future requirements in the software delivery lifecycle is key. As CI/CD technologies continue to evolve and automated testing using provisioned test environments becomes more common in mainframe application development teams, the outlined branching strategy can also evolve to maximize the benefits from these advances.
