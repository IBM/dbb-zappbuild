# Contribution Guidelines
* Read and agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild/blob/development/DCO1.1.txt) document.
* Fork and Create a Pull Request
    * Fork the dbb-zappbuild repo, create a new topic branch from development and apply your changes there. Create a Pull Request from your topic branch against the dbb-zappbuild development branch.
    * Limit each Pull Request to one enhancement or bug fix. Don't bundle multiple enhancements/changes (e.g. a new enhancement and a fix to an existing sample) into a single Pull Request - create one PR for the new enhancement, and a separate PR for the fix.
    * For complex changes, try to squash your changes into a single commit. Don't create a PR consisting of 20 commits that show your work in progress. Before you create the PR, squash your changes into a single commit.
* Send an email to drbruce@us.ibm.com with a link to the Pull Request and the following statement:
```
DCO 1.1 signed-off-by: Random J Developer random@developer.org.
```
* The contribution will be reviewed by a member of the IBM Dependency Based Build development team.
