# Build Property management
###############################################################
# zAppBuild allows you to manage default properties and file properties:
# - Documentation on how to override corresponding default build properties can be found at:
#   https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild/docs/FilePropertyManagement.md

# ### Properties to enable and configure build property overwrites using individual artifact properties files

# flag to enable the zAppBuild capability to load individual artifact properties files for individual source files, 
# Note: To activate the loading of property files for a group of files, it is recommended to use the file property path
# syntax instead. (i.e. loadFileLevelProperties=true :: **/cobol/*.cbl to enable it for all cobol files)
# default: false
loadFileLevelProperties=false

# Property to enable/disable and configure build property overwrites using language definition property mapping 
# file - languageDefinitionMapping.properties
# If loadFileLevelProperties is set as true above, the properties from the individual artifact properties files will override the 
# properties from language definition properties file.
# Note: To activate the loading of property files for a group of files, it is recommended to use the file property path
# syntax instead. (i.e. loadLanguageDefinitionProperties=true :: **/cobol/*.cbl to enable it for all cobol files)
loadLanguageDefinitionProperties=false

# relative path to folder containing individual artifact properties files
# assumed to be relative to ${workspace}/${application}
propertyFilePath=properties

# file extension for individual artifact properties files
# default: properties
