# Application Configuration
This folder contains application specific configuration properties used by the zAppBuild Groovy build and utility scripts. It is intended to be copied as a high level folder in the application repository or main application repository if the application source files are distributed across multiple repositories. Once copied to the application repository, users should review the default property files and modify any values as needed. 

At the beginning of the build, the `application-conf/application.properties` file will automatically be loaded into the [DBB BuildProperties class](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6T76_1.0.4/scriptorg.html#build-properties-class). Use the `applicationPropFiles` property (see table below) to load additional application property files.

## Property File Descriptions
Since all properties will be loaded into a single static instance of BuildProperties, the organization and naming convention of the *property files* are somewhat arbitrary and targeted more for self documentation and understanding.

### application.properties
This property file is loaded automatically at the beginning of the build and contains application specific properties used mainly by `build.groovy` but can also be a place to declare properties used by multiple language scripts. Additional property files are loaded based on the content of the `applicationPropFiles` property.

Property | Description
--- | ---
runzTests | Boolean value to specify if zUnit tests should be run.  Defaults to `false`, to enable zUnit Tests, set value to `true`.
applicationPropFiles | Comma separated list of additional application property files to load. Supports both absolute and relative file paths.  Relative paths assumed to be relative to ${workspace}/${application}/application-conf/.
applicationSrcDirs | Comma separated list of all source directories included in application build. Each directory is assumed to be a local Git repository clone. Supports both absolute and relative paths though for maximum reuse of collected dependency data relative paths should be used.  Relative paths assumed to be relative to ${workspace}.
buildOrder | Comma separated list of the build script processing order.
mainBuildBranch | The main build branch of the main application repository.  Used for cloning collections for topic branch builds instead of rescanning the entire application.
gitRepositoryURL | git repository URL of the application repository to establish links to the changed files in the build result properties | false
excludeFileList | Files to exclude when scanning or running full build.
skipImpactCalculationList | Files for which the impact analysis should be skipped in impact build
jobCard | JOBCARD for JCL execs
resolveSubsystems | boolean flag to configure the SearchPathDependencyResolver to evaluate if resolved dependencies impact the file flags isCICS, isSQL, isDLI, isMQ when creating the LogicalFile
impactSearch | Impact finder resolution search configuration leveraging the SearchPathImpactFinder API. Sample configurations are inlcuded below, next to the previous rule definitions.


### file.properties
Location of file properties, script mappings and file level property overrides.  All file properties for the entire application, including source files in distributed repositories of the application need to be contained either in this file or in other property files in the `application-conf` directory. Look for column 'Overridable' in the tables below for build properties that can have file level property overrides. 

Property | Description 
--- | --- 
dbb.scriptMapping | DBB configuration file properties association build files to language scripts
dbb.scannerMapping | DBB scanner mapping to overwrite the file scanner. File property
cobol_testcase | File property to indicate a generated zUnit cobol test case to use a different set of source and output libraries

### languageConfigurationMapping.properties
Sample Language Configuration mapping properties used by dbb-zappbuild/utilities/BuildUtilities.groovy.

This contains the mapping of the files and their corresponding Language Configuration properties files residing in `zAppBuild/build-conf/language-conf` to override the default file properties.

Example: The entry - `epsnbrvl.cbl=languageConfigProps01`, means the file properties of file `epsnbrvl.cbl` will be overridden by the properties mentioned in `dbb-zappbuild/build-conf/language-conf/languageConfigProps01.properties`

See the [language configuration mapping documentation](../../../docs/FilePropertyManagement.md#language-configuration-mapping) for more details on how to enable and use language configuration mapping.
