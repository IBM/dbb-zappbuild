# Build Property management
###############################################################
# 
# zAppBuild allows you to manage default properties and file properties:
#
# - Default build properties are defined in the /build-conf and /application-conf property files (e.g. Cobol.properties)
#  
# - File properties override corresponding default build properties, and are defined through one of two methods:
#   - Overwrites for groups or individual files 
#     - Typically defined in file.properties using the DBB file property path syntax
#     - See: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dbb/1.1.0?topic=scripts-how-organize-build-script#file-properties
#   - Overwrites for an individual file
#     - Defined in an individual property file located in a configurable subfolder (e.g. properties/epsmlist.cbl.properties)
#
# A typical scenario for using zAppBuild's capability to set build properties for an individual source file via a corresponding
# individual property file is to overwrite compile or link options. This approach might help ease the migration of properties
# from the previous build system.
#
# Individual property files are resolved using the pattern <propertyFilePath directory>/<sourceFile>.<propertyFileExtension>. For example,
#  for the source file epsmlist.cbl, the process searches for a file in the propertyFilePath directory
#  with the name epsmlist.cbl.properties.
#  If no corresponding property file is found, the build will use the default build values. (Or, if any file properties were defined
#  using the DBB file property path syntax, then the build will use those.)
#
# Note: Overwrites for a specific build property should be managed either via the file property path syntax or
#  in the individual property files, but not both. The following example shows how both approaches for defining
#  file properties can be combined to specify a set of build properties for the same source file:
#
# ### Example: Using the file property path syntax and individual property files to define build properties for a source file named app/cobol/AB123456.cbl
# - You can use the file property path syntax to define a file property for a group of files. The below defines the deployType for
#  all source files in the folder cobol beginning with AB* to be BATCHLOAD:
#
#  cobol_deployType = BATCHLOAD :: **/cobol/AB*.cbl
#
# - At the same time, you can define an individual file property file for app/cobol/AB123456.cbl with the following build property:
#  
#  cobol_compileParms = LIB,SOURCE
# 
# - During the build, the file app/cobol/AB123456.cbl will have the deployType BATCHLOAD and the COBOL compile parameters LIB and SOURCE.
# ### End example ###

# ### Properties to enable and configure build property overwrites using individual property files

# flag to enable the zAppBuild capability to load individual property files for individual source files, 
# Note: To activate the loading of property files for a group of files, it is recommended to use the file property path
# syntax instead. (i.e. loadFileLevelProperties=true :: **/cobol/*.cbl to enable it for all cobol files)
# default: false
loadFileLevelProperties=false

# relative path to folder containing individual property files
# assumed to be relative to ${workspace}/${application}
propertyFilePath=properties

# file extension for individual property files
# default: properties
propertyFileExtension=properties
