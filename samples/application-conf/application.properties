# ### Properties to enable and configure build property overrides using individual artifact properties files

# flag to enable the zAppBuild capability to load individual artifact properties files for all individual source files. 
# Note: To only activate loadFileLevelProperties for a group of files, it is recommended to use DBB's file property path
# syntax in application-conf/file.properties instead.
# default: false

# Property to enable/disable and configure build property overrides using language configuration mapping 
# file - languageConfigurationMapping.properties
# If loadFileLevelProperties is set as true above, the properties from the individual artifact properties files will override the 
# properties from language configuration properties file.
# Note: To only activate loadLanguageConfigurationProperties for a group of files, it is recommended to use DBB's file property path
