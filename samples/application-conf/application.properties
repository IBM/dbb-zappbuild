# Flag to expand impact analysis to automatically include all mandatory submodules to build list in pipeline builds with a DBB Metadatastore connection based on the intermediate build list after impact analysis
# This functionality queries and relies on the DBB Output collection of the application

# The feature is specifically useful for applications using static calls to increase the isolation of the build environment
# If the property is set to true, if a main program undergoes a change, all statically called sub programs are recompiled
# Default: false
# This property is setup as a DBB file property. This allows to enable the feature just for a subset of your build files
# Sample to inspect the intermediate build list add submodules for Cobol build files
